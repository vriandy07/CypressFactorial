## Project Description ##

The Factorial Calculator is In Mathematics, factorial is an important function, which is used to find how many ways things can be arranged or the ordered set of numbers. The well known interpolating function of the factorial function was discovered by Daniel Bernoulli. The factorial concept is used in many mathematical concepts such as probability, permutations and combinations, sequences and series, etc. In short, a factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it till 1. For example, the factorial of 3 represents the multiplication of numbers 3, 2, 1, i.e. 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 and is equal to 6.
